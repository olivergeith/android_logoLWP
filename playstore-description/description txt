Description
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This is a Live Wallpaper, that displays the current batterylevel.

So, what is cool about it?
------------------------------------------
...well, you can use any image you want as Battery-Image!
Normally you would choose a logo-image of your favorite game, tv-series, or whatever...look at the screenshots to get an idea. 

Look at my other free APP "The BatteryLWP"...there you can check this out for free. 

So, why is this a paid APP ?
------------------------------------------
...well, this App has a lot of more features to optimize the Battery-Image
...a lot of more features to play with
...and it will gain lots of more features in the future!

Why is there only one logo-image included in this app?
------------------------------------------
... well, that is because of copyright on lots of images...I'm simply not allowed to provide them!
But that should be no problem for you...be creative...design your own logo-images.  
Save them to your sdcard and load them into this APP.
If you need examples of some nice logos...go the the Google+ Community of this APP and download some over there...
Or simply use the google picture search and google & download some cool images! 

How to ?
------------------------------------------
...well, that is simple....this App uses any image(I call it logo!) as Battery-Icon. 
Any Image?
...well, best results will be with square images with about 512x512 pixels and a circular design, with transparent parts (look for png's)!
... on HD devices you may want to use images with 1080x1080 pixel (personally I don't see a big difference on my Nexus 5...but that is up to you)
Where to put them?
...well, simply copy them for example to your phones /sdcard/Pictures/logos/...
...go into the settings of this app (Style-Settings) and load the logo-image from there!
Plug your phone to the charger and see the charge animation! 
...This will give you a better idea, how the battery will look like on the different battery levels!  

Is it HD?
------------------------------------------
...well, the battery "icon" is rendered according to your devices display resolution...so if your device is fullHD...this wallpaper is fullHD too!
...of course this depends on your logo-image...if it has only 16x16 pixel, well...then it won't be HD!!!
